- A package can contain at most one library crate. It can contain as many binary crates as youâ€™d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).

- Cargo follows a convention that `src/main.rs` is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains src/lib.rs, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and `src/lib.rs` is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to rustc to build the library or binary.

- A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the src/bin directory: each file will be a separate binary crate
